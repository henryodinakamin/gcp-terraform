# Infrastructure as Code for Google Cloud Platform Using Terraform
How to create GCP infrastructure using [Hashicorp Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/). This repository contains simple set of Terraform scripts to create individual GCP services. It is also important to note that, this is not following any **best practices** of writing Terraform code. The idea here is to make things work for the first time and improvise based on your needs. For all of the examples to work, the following pre-requisites are required.
* A valid GCP account
* The key of the user/service account got downloaded into your local machine
* Terraform is installed and configured (Terraform v0.11.11 is being used here)
* All the examples are run from a Mac machine

When a security key is downloaded, keep it in a local directory and export the location in an environment variable. Make sure that the key is removed as and when your needs are over to prevent from your account being compromised. Key rotation is also a good method.
```bash
export GOOGLE_CLOUD_KEYFILE_JSON=‎⁨‎⁨‎⁨‎⁨/Users/RajT/workspace/gcp-terraform/keys/infra.json
echo $GOOGLE_CLOUD_KEYFILE_JSON
```
When you go to each of the directories, make sure that you edit the scripts to include the following parameters.
* Your GCP project ID
* Your preferred GCP region
* Your preferred GCP zone

Once you are done with all these steps given above, use the following Terraform commands
```bash
# Make the initialization
terraform init
# Format the source code
terraform fmt
# See the plan of action
terraform plan
# Create the infrastructure
terraform apply
# Once all the work is completed, destroy the infrastructure that you have created
terraform destroy
```

## List of Scripts Directories
The following directories contain Terraform scripts. Some of the scripts are dependent on the scripts in the other directories. Wherever there are dependencies like this, it is called out with **DEPENDENCIES**
* **cs** - This contains Terraform scripts to create a Google Cloud Storage bucket in a given region
* **vpc** - This contains Terraform scripts to create a VPC with subnet for creating your GCP service resources. This is created keeping in mind for creating a private K8S cluster. This contains two secondary IP ranges. One secondary range will be used for pod IP addresses. The other secondary range will be used for service ClusterIPs
* **firewall** - This contains Terraform scripts to create a firewall rule in a given VPC
* **k8s-cluster** - This contains Terraform scripts to create a **private Kubernetes (K8S) cluster with Istio enabled**. It is also made sure that this private cluster is accessible only from the bastion host VM that is created in the same VPC subnet. SSH into the bastion host, and then install Cloud SDK, kubectl and other required software to manage the private K8S cluster using [Installation Instructions of Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/downloads-apt-get).
* **vm** - This contains Terraform scripts to create a VM in the a given VPC
* **composer** - This contains Terraform scripts to create a Google Composer environment. This has some issues such as it takes pretty long time to create the whole thing. When you destroy, it doesn't destroy the dependent services such as the Google Cloud Storage bucket. **CAUTION** is to be exercised when you are planning to use this for production purposes. Check the warning sign in the [Terraform Documentation](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/google/r/composer_environment.html) page before using.
